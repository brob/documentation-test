## Overview

A webhook is a feature that sends a signal whenever a specific event occurs. Think of it as a notification that triggers actions. We are going to configure a webhook that will trigger published content displaying in our frontend.

## Configure a webhook

First, we're going to navigate to the **Webhooks** section of our project, and click on the `Add` button.

A screen will pop up, let's complete it using the following information:

- **Name:** This is the name of our webhook, we'll call it “Deploy to Storefront”
- **Description:** This is the description for our webhook. We'll write “Trigger published”.
- **Include payload:** This enabled switch means that data will be sent via the webhook. We'll leave it as it is.
- **Method:** We'll use the dropdown to select the `POST` method.
- **URL:** This is our webhook URL or build hook.

  - **Netlify:** Build Hook, go to your site in Netlify and navigate to `Site configuration > Build & deploy > Continuous deployment > Build hooks` and click `Add a build hook`.

  Give your hook the name by typing “Deploy from Hygraph” in the `Build hook name` field, and use the `Branch to build` dropdown to select `main` - if not already chosen.

  Clicking `Save` generated the build hook. Copy the `URL` and paste it into the Hygraph Webhook modal in the `URL` field.

- **Secret key:** Add an optional secret key to sign the payload of our webhook, to allow the other end to check that the source is genuine.
- **Triggers:** This is where we select which Models, Stages, Actions and Sources should trigger your webhook. Since we want to be able to preview our product entry drafts, we'll use the `Content model` Dropdown to select the `Product` model, and the `Stage` dropdown to select `PUBLISHED`. We won't select anything under `Actions` and `Sources`, because we don't want to limit them.
- **Headers:** Optionally configure headers by adding additional Key and Value data, we will leave this blank.

Next, click `Add` at the top of the model to save your webhook.

Once saved, you should see your webhook on the main screen.

You can test your new webhook by adding a new product content entry and publishing. When you click `Publish`, the webhook will automatically trigger Netlify rebuild your storefront!

To setup a deployment to Vercel, follow our step-by-step guide on how to [deploy to Vercel using Hygraph Webhooks](/guides/webhooks/trigger-static-build).

You can also setup static deployments to Netlify using our [Hygraph-Netlify Intergration](/integrations/connect-netlify): This integration allows you to install a button in the Hygraph sidebar of a content model for manual redeploys, alongside a visual indicator of deployment status.
