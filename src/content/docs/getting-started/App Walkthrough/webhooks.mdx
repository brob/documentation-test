In the **Webhooks** section, you can add webhooks to your project's deployment according to triggers you can configure.

This section displays each webhook in a card, with options to edit its configuration, view its logs, and delete it.

<Card theme="warning">

**Webhooks are environment specific**. This means their configuration is applied per environment. Take this into consideration if you're working with a project using more than one environment.
