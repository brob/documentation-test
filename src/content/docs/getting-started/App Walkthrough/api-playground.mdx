You can use the **API Playground** to test out API calls, by experimenting with querying and mutating data.

In the API Playground you can:

- Add a query
- Prettify your query
- Select an environment
- Select a stage
- Select a locale
- Execute a query
- Provide query variables
- Pass custom headers

You will find information on how to do all this by accessing [this document](/docs/api-reference/basics/api-playground).
