The quick start checklist, initially located on the lower right corner of the screen of your project, is designed to onboard you into using Hygraph.

The checklist will take you through your first steps in the Hygraph app, from creating a project, to enabling API access to share your content with others.

It contains a progression line, so you can follow how far along you are in the process, the steps, with a brief description of each one, and a button that links you to the place in the app where each step will be carried out. As you move forward, completed steps will be ticked off and the following one will display.

You can use the chevron button on top of the progression line to collapse the list for a more minimal view, then click on it again to fully display it. The collapsed view shows only the checklkist progression bar, and a line for the next step.

If you close the checklist using the **X** button, a card will display at the top of the dashboard. The card shows the same progression line, as well as a link to reopen the checklist, in case you wish you have it displayed again.

**The steps:**

- **Create a project:** Given that you will only see the checklist when you first access your project dashboard, the **Create a project** step will be ticked off already. 
- **Set up your schema:** The second step on the checklist suggests creating the minimal content necessary for a functional schema, that is, one model containing one field. Both of these actions are covered in our getting started tutorial: you will find information on creating your first models and adding field to them [in our Getting Started tutorial](/docs/getting-started/build-content-models).
- **Create content:** The third step on the checklist suggests creating content using our intuitive **Content editor**. These actions are covered in our getting started tutorial under [content creation](/docs/getting-started/content-creation) and [content publishing](/docs/getting-started/additional-content-features#content-publishing).
- **Explore your content API:** The fourth step takes you to our API Playground, where you can fetch content using GraphQL. Use of the **API Playground** is covered in our getting started tutorial, in our [queries](/docs/getting-started/api-playground-queries) and [mutations](/docs/getting-started/api-playground-mutations) practice.
- **Make your API accessible:** The final step on the checklist takes you the **API Access** section of your **Project settings**, where you can enable access to your API. This is covered in getting started tutorial, in the [connect storefront](/docs/getting-started/connect-storefront#tokens-and-permissions) lesson.
