Our Getting Started tutorial takes you from the creation of a project from scratch all the way through to its implementation.

<VideoEmbed videoId="2AJikoCU02k"/>

Our pet project is an e-commerce that offers wearables and home goods for sale. We'll start by planning the flow of information, then we'll build a schema based on that, create some content for it, query that content, and integrate it with a front end.

<Card theme= "info" title="Choose your own adventure">

You can follow the complete tutorial, or you can skip project creation and work on frontend implementation, queries, and mutations.

You'll be able to choose your path [at the end of this document](/getting-started/onboarding-overview#choose-your-path).

## What you will learn


<Card theme= "warning">

- We'll be covering a first approach to all important features. More in-depth content will be offered as additional resources.
- We'll provide exercises along with our step-by-step explanations. Part of them are required, and part of them are offered as additional practice. You can choose to do them or not without affecting your frontend implementation.

### Wrap-up

Our [Getting Sterted project wrap-up](/getting-started/getting-started-wrap-up) contains a recap on our learning objectives, a list of best practices for your Hygraph projects, and some useful links so you can continue learning.

## Prerequisites for this tutorial

- Have a Hygraph account. If you don't have one, you can create one [here](https://app.hygraph.com/signup).
- Have some GraphQL knowledge.
- Basic understanding of content modeling: [Check out this guide](https://hygraph.com/blog/essential-guide-to-content-modeling)
- For Next frontend connection to Hygraph:
  - Code editor or IDE. We are using VS Code.
  - Current version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
  - [E-commerce starter using Next.js 13](https://github.com/hygraph/hygraph-next-commerce-starter)
  - [Netlify account](https://app.netlify.com/signup)

## Choose your path

Our starting point will be a cloned project where you will be able to choose your own adventure. We have two options for you:

- **Option 1: Clone and follow the complete Hygraph onboarding experience**

  - This project clone includes Navigation, SEO models, and image assets.
  - You will build the Hygraph project by moving through the step-by-step learning path.

<Button

  size="md"
  variant="solid"
  theme="primary"
  iconRight="ArrowRight"
>Select option 1</Button>

- **Option 2: Practice frontend implementation, queries, mutations**

  - This project clone includes the complete Hygraph project with models, assets, and content entries.
  - You will receive a fully functioning project and learn how to connect Hygraph to a frontend implementation to practice queries and mutations in the API Playground.

<Button
  href="https://app.hygraph.com/clone/4d65d295cd1e4912aa401fb15f72d40d?name=GS2023%20Stage%202"
  size="md"
  variant="solid"
  theme="primary"
  iconRight="ArrowRight"
>Select option 2</Button>

## Cloning the project

Whether you select path 1 or 2, you will get a cloning screen similar to this one:

![Clone project screen](/images/getting-started/clone-project-screen.png)

All you have to do is give it a name - one is provided but you can edit it - you can add a description, which is optional, use the dropdown to select a region for the clone, and click `Clone now`.

Cloning may take a couple of minutes, and after that you'll land on your project's dashboard.
