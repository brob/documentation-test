## Overview

When we create product entries for our e-commerce, we want to be able to select values - such as product size or color - from a dropdown menu. This makes sense for our project because we want to be able to only publish products in certain colors & sizes. Making this a dropdown in our content creation screen ensures that only the values we predefine will be used for those product characteristics.

In Hygraph, you do this by adding a dropdown menu to your model. This dropdown gets the list of values from an enumeration that you need to configure before you create the dropdown field.

An enumeration is a predefined set of values that represents a list of possible options. We can use enumerations to group values within a type and then use them when we add a dropdown field.

We will be using enumerations for the components that we are going to create in our next lesson. Let's configure them.

## Configure enumerations

Adding enumerations is very simple.

![Adding enumerations](/images/docs/getting-started/add-enumeration-screen.png)

We always add them in the same way:

1. In the Schema editor, we click on `+Add` next to `Enumerations`.
2. We then type in a `Display name`, which is the name that we will see in the Schema.
3. We also add an `API ID`, which we can use later to access the enumeration through the API Playground.
4. Next, we add enumeration values by typing them in the `Values` field and then clicking on `+Add to list`. We will need to do this for each value.
5. To save our enumeration, we simply click `Add enumeration`.

For this tutorial, we will add 4 enumerations: separate sizes for shoes and clothes, and separate colors for wearables and decor.

Use the following information to add them:

**Clothes size**

- **Display name:** Clothes size
- **API ID:** ClothesSize
- **Enumeration values:** XS, S, M, L, XL

**Shoes size**

- **Display name:** Shoes size
- **API ID:** ShoesSize
- **Enumeration values:** Size_35, Size_36, Size_37, Size_38, Size_39, Size_40, Size_41, Size_42, Size_43, Size_44

**Wearable items color**

- **Display name:** Wearable items color
- **API ID:** WearableItemsColor
- **Enumeration values:** Red, Green, Blue, Black, White

![Wearable items color enumeration](/images/docs/getting-started/enumeration-wearables-color.png)

**Decor items color**

- **Display name:** Decor items color
- **API ID:** DecorColor
- **Enumeration values:** Gold, Silver, Bronze, Cobalt

After adding your **Enumerations** the left sidebar should look like this:

Once you've created all enumerations, move on to our next lesson:
