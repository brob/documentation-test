## Overview

In this lesson, you'll learn how to create a Next app and connect it to Hygraph. Let's quickly go over how to set up a new Next project from scratch. Then, we will clone the e-commerce Hygraph starter that will be used for the rest of the tutorial.

## Quick overview: Creating a new Next app

To start, we need to initialize a new `Next.js 13` project. Open up your terminal and navigate to where you want your project, then run the following command:

```
npx create-next-app hygraph-boutique
```

The interactive setup will ask you questions to configure your project. Initialize with the following answers:

- Typescript: No
- ESLint: Yes
- Tailwind CSS: Yes
- src/ directory: No
- App Router: Yes
- Import alias: No

After choosing the options, the CLI will install all the necessary pieces to run your `Next.js` site.

Once the installation completes, open the new Next project in a code editor of your choice. We need to adjust the default Tailwind styling that Next.js gives us from the installation.

Remove the global CSS rules in app/globals.css except following Tailwind imports:

```js
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

## Clone the Hygraph E-commerce starter

<Card theme="info" title="Starter Recap">

All Hygraph starters are located on the main dashboard after to login. Scroll past the “My Projects” section to the “Start a new Project” section and choose the E-commerce shop starter. This will create a new hygraph project as well as the frontend template for a website.

Since, we already have a Hygraph project, let's clone the starter without creating a new Hygraph project. [Here's the link to the repository](https://github.com/hygraph/hygraph-next-commerce-starter).

Type the following command into your terminal to clone the starter:

```
git clone https://github.com/hygraph/hygraph-next-commerce-starter.git
```

Navigate to the project directory and type `npm install` to install the package dependencies.

In the next lesson, we will connect our e-commerce storefront to our existing Hygraph project.
