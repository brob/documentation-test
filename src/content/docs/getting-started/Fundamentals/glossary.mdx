## Basic concepts

| Concept          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| API Playground   | The [API Playground](/api-reference/basics/api-playground), located on the left sidebar of the Hygraph app, allows you to to experiment with querying, and mutating data.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Assets           | The [Asset](/api-reference/content-api/assets) model is included in every project by default. It is commonly used for images, but can also support any file type. Assets can be fetched, referenced, transformed, uploaded, updated, published, localized, deleted, and embedded.                                                                     |
| Component        | A [component](/guides/schema/components) is a predefined set of fields that can be reused across models and content entries. You can think of a component as a flexible, reusable template where you define the fields that will be used inside a component once, and then fill them with different content every time you use it in a content entry. |
| Content modeling | The [content model](/getting-started/fundamentals/content-modeling) defines the schema of your content. It describes what kind of content you want to store, how it relates to each other, and in what way it can be edited within Hygraph.                                                                                                                    |
| Content views    | Hygraph features default and custom [content views](/guides/content/content-views). The default content views are the system views which list all content entries that have been created based on the respective content models. Custom content views are filtered for specific content entries.                                                      |
| Enumeration      | An [enumeration](/api-reference/schema/enumerations) (or enum for short) can be used to group values within a type. Enums can be useful to filter, and define certain content entries in your project.                                                                                                                                                |
| Model            | You can define your schema by adding models and then adding fields to said models. Click [here](/guides/first-steps/create-a-model) to learn more about models.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Mutations        | Operations that allow you to insert new data or modify the existing data on the server-side. Click [here](/api-reference/content-api/mutations) to learn more about mutations.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Preview URLs     | [Preview URLs](/guides/schema/preview-urls) are automatically generated links that allow you to preview content in your frontend before it's published. Configuring this feature adds a button to the Content Editor's right sidebar, so editors can quickly access content previews.                                                                 |
| Relations        | References, often referred as [relations](/api-reference/schema/field-types#reference), allow you to connect one or more models together, and even reference multiple models as a single field type with GraphQL Union Types.                                                                                                                         |
| Remote sources   | [Remote Sources](/guides/schema/remote-sources) is our content federation utility. It allows adding content from other systems and sources to the Hygraph API without having to migrate the content itself.                                                                                                                                           |
| Schema editor    | Inside the schema editor, you can add fields, create relationships between models, and much more. Click [here](/getting-started/app-walkthrough/schema-editor) to learn more about our schema editor.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Sidebar          | When editing models in the schema editor, your sidebar is the second tab in the center section of the screen. Edit the contents of the sidebar tab to [customize the sidebar](/guides/content/customize-sidebar) you see in the content editor while creating or editing content.                                                                     |
| System fields    | All default, and custom content types come with some managed [system fields](/api-reference/schema/system-fields). These fields reflect certain states of your content, such as when it was last updated, or published at.                                                                                                                            |

## Content stages

This list offers a brief description of the two content stages every Hygraph project has by default.

| Stage name | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Draft      | Content that has never been published. Draft content can be added, edited and saved, without affecting published content.                                                                                                            |
| Published  | Published content. If the published button displays green, it means content that has been pushed live. If the published button displays blue, it means a new draft version has been saved and the published content is now outdated. |

Additionally, you can create custom content stages for your project. [Click](/guides/content/publishing-content#content-stages) to find out more.
