## Learning objectives recap

If you followed our complete tutorial, you learned:

- How to plan your content flow
- How to build a schema in layers of complexity
- How to work with queries & mutations
- How to connect to a frontend

## Best practices

- Keep the project's business goals in mind.
- Plan & sketch your content flow before you use the schema builder.
- We often build complex schemas in layers because of how models are interconnected.
- Name models and fields in a way that allows your collaborators to work intuitively.
