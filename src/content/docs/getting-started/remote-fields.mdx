## Overview

This step of our **Getting Started** tutorial covers Remote Fields, one of our [Content Federation](/getting-started/fundamentals/content-federation) features.

We use **Remote Fields** for data enrichment. You can add them to a model in your schema to fetch data from a Remote Source. This type of field connects remote data to a specific entry in that model, and it's always related to a single remote source & custom type.

To be able to add a Remote Field to a model in your Schema, you need to have configured a Remote Source first, so make sure [you have followed the previous step of our tutorial](/getting-started/add-remote-source) before you start this one.

## The use case

A common use case is to use Remote Fields to facilitate e-commerce by consolidating product listings from multiple suppliers onto one platform. For the purposes of this tutorial, we will add a Remote Field to our **Product** model and use it to fetch review data from the `DEMO Hygraph API` that we connected in our remote sources lesson, so it can be displayed on our front end.

## Adding a Remote Field

We're going to use the Remote Source that we configured in the previous lesson to add a Remote Field to our **Product** Model.

  <source
    src="https://media.graphassets.com/mDIeXmgzQ0yis5Uv7drY"
    type="video/mp4"
  />
</Video>

Let's go to our Schema, select the model, and then click on the `REST` Remote Field option on the right sidebar.

We'll write “Reviews” in the `Display name` field. This will autocomplete the `API ID` field, which we'll leave as is.

We can see that “HyDemoAPI” is selected as our `Remote source` by default, which we'll also leave as is, along with the `Method`. However, since we want to fetch review data for your **Product** model, we'll change the `Return type` selection to “Reviews” using the dropdown. What we just did here is select one of the `custom type definitions` that we configured for our remote source in the last lesson.

Finally, we'll write `/api/reviews/product/{{doc.productSlug}}` under `Path`. This path will be added to our remote source base path to get a resulting endpoint. `doc.productSlug` references the content entry, so we'll be able to fetch reviews for specific products.

We'll click `Add` to save.
