You can use headers as a global way to send more specific requests to our API.

## `gcms-locales`

This header works in the same way as [using the query input for locales](/api-reference/content-api/localization#fallback-locales).

You can pass the `gcms-locales` header for localized content with your required locales. It is just another way besides the query param to decide which locales a query should return. Basically, the placement is different - header vs. query - but the result is the same. Using one or the other mostly comes down to the developer's preference.

**Why use `gmcs-locales` instead of the query param then?**

To keep queries exactly the same across different environments - production, development, etc. - and then instead of passing the param to the query, you use the header.

In some specific cases passing headers could be easier than putting the params in the query itself.

Example usage `'gcms-locales': 'rb, de, en'`:

```js
const fetch = require('cross-fetch');

const headers = {
  'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  'gcms-locales': 'rb, de, en',
};

const body = JSON.stringify({ query: '{ products { name } }' });

const { products } = await fetch('<your-hygraph-endpoint>', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers,
  body,
});
```

You can also pass an array of locales to `gcms-locales` to define your fallback preference.

## `gcms-stage`

This header works in the same way as [using the stage input on a query](/api-reference/content-api/queries#fetching-stages).

You can pass the `gcms-stage` header to specify the stage of your content. It is just another way besides the query param to decide which stage a query should return. Basically, the placement is different - header vs. query - but the result is the same. Using one or the other mostly comes down to the developer's preference.

**Why use `gcms-stage` instead of the query param then?**

To keep queries exactly the same across different environments - production, development, etc. - and then instead of passing the param to the query, you use the header.

In some specific cases passing headers could be easier than putting the params in the query itself.

Example usage `'gcms-stage': 'DRAFT'`:

```js
const fetch = require('cross-fetch');

const headers = {
  'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  'gcms-stage': 'DRAFT',
};

const body = JSON.stringify({ query: '{ products { name } }' });

const { products } = await fetch('<your-hygraph-endpoint>', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers,
  body,
});
```

## `hyg-stale-if-error` 

This header for the [High performance endpoint](/api-reference/basics/caching#stale-if-error) lets you set `stale-if-error` on a per query basis.

This cache header can be used to fine-tune our default caching behavior. For instance, we could use it to make sure we return stale data on errors for much longer.

The need to use this header highly depends on the use-cases and whether it's important to always get fresh data or to always get data, no matter if stale or new.

Example usage `'hyg-stale-if-error': '21600'`:

```js
const fetch = require('cross-fetch');

const headers = {
  'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  'hyg-stale-if-error': '21600',
};

const body = JSON.stringify({ query: '{ products { name } }' });

const { products } = await fetch('<your-hygraph-endpoint>', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers,
  body,
});
```

The values are in seconds.

This is only available on the <b>High performance</b> endpoint.

The default `Stale-if-error` for all shared clusters is 86400s (1 day).

## `hyg-stale-while-revalidate`

This header for the [High performance endpoint](/api-reference/basics/caching#stale-while-revalidate) lets you set `stale-while-revalidate` on a per query basis.

This cache header can be used to fine-tune our default caching behavior. For instance, we could use it to make sure we return stale data while the cache is revalidating.

The need to use this header highly depends on the use-cases and whether it's important to always get fresh data or to always get data, no matter if stale or new.

Example usage `'hyg-stale-while-revalidate': '27'`:

```js
const fetch = require('cross-fetch');

const headers = {
  'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  'hyg-stale-while-revalidate': '27',
};

const body = JSON.stringify({ query: '{ products { name } }' });

const { products } = await fetch('<your-hygraph-endpoint>', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers,
  body,
});
```

The values are in seconds.

This is only available on the <b>High performance</b> endpoint.

The default `stale-while-revalidate` for our shared clusters is `0`.

## `x-debug-complexity`

You can use this header to enable complexity debugging, so the compexity tree is returned.

The possible values are `true` & `false`.

Example usage `'x-debug-complexity': 'true'`:

```js
const fetch = require('cross-fetch');

const headers = {
  'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  'x-debug-complexity': 'true',
};

const body = JSON.stringify({ query: '{ products { name } }' });

const { products } = await fetch('<your-hygraph-endpoint>', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers,
  body,
});
```
