import { Card, CardGrid, Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

You can create your own content stages inside the Hygraph UI, and query content from these stages, as well as publish to.

By default all content is served from the `DRAFT` stage, unless configured otherwise via a Permanent Auth Token, or by filtering.

You can [create custom content stages](/guides/content/content-stages#creating-custom-content-stages) to publish to from `DRAFT`. Each project comes with stages `DRAFT`, and `PUBLISHED`.

<Card theme="warning">

Custom content stages are available to paid plans. [Upgrade your plan](/pricing).

**Content stages are environment specific**. This means their configuration is applied per environment. Take this into consideration if you're working with a project using more than one environment.

</Card>

## Create a content stage

1. Navigate to your project settings.
2. Open the Content Stages tab.
3. Press "Add Stage" at the bottom of the list of stages.
4. Provide the Display name, API ID, a Color for the label and Description in the modal.
5. Press create.

<Card theme="info">

Creating content stages besides the two offered by default - `DRAFT` & `PUBLISHED` - is available to paid plans. [Upgrade your plan](/pricing).

## Edit a content stage

1. Navigate to the content stage you want to edit.
2. Press "edit" in the lower left corner of the stage card.

## Publishing content

Hygraph automatically generates a publish mutation for each of your content models, including the asset model.

If the models have localized fields, you can greater control the `locales` you want to publish, and if you want to publish the base entry.

Each time you publish to a content stage, you will create a snapshot of the data as a [version](#versioning).

For example, if we have a product model, the mutation `publishProduct` will exist. You can use this mutation to publish content to a content stage.

| Argument            | Input Tpye                | Description                                                                                         |
| ------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `where`             | `ProductWhereUniqueInput` | The content entry you want to publish, using a [filter](/api-reference/content-api/filtering). |
| `to`                | `[Stage!]! = [PUBLISHED]` | The target published content stage.                                                                 |
| `locales`           | `[Locale!]`               | Optional locales to publish.                                                                        |
| `publishBase`       | `Boolean = true`          | Whether to publish the base content entry.                                                          |
| `withDefaultLocale` | `Boolean = true`          |                                                                                                     |

<Tabs panelHeight={180}>
  <TabItem label="Without locales">

```graphql
mutation {
  publishProduct(where: { id: "..." }, to: PUBLISHED) {
    id
  }
}
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="With locales">

```graphql
mutation {
  publishProduct(
    where: { id: "..." }
    to: PUBLISHED
    publishBase: true
    locales: [en]
    withDefaultLocale: true
  ) {
    id
  }
}
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Card theme="info" title="Pro Tip">

Every mutation besides `publish` and `unpublish`, will only update the `DRAFT` version.

For instance, when you update an entry in the UI, you are doing an `updateMutation`, which changes the `DRAFT` version.

To update the published version, you would need to publish that `DRAFT`.

</Card>

## Unpublishing content

Similar to publishing content, you can unpublish from a selected content stage.

For example, if we have a product model, the mutation `unpublishProduct` will exist. You can use this mutation to unpublish content from a content stage.

| Argument        | Input Tpye                | Description                                                                                           |
| --------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `where`         | `ProductWhereUniqueInput` | The content entry you want to unpublish, using a [filter](/api-reference/content-api/filtering). |
| `from`          | `[Stage!]! = [PUBLISHED]` | The target [content stage](/api-reference/content-api/content-stages) to unpublish from.         |
| `locales`       | `[Locale!]`               | Optional locales to unpublish.                                                                        |
| `unpublishBase` | `Boolean = true`          | Whether to unpublish the base content entry or not.                                                   |

<Tabs panelHeight={180}>
  <TabItem label="Without locales">

```graphql
mutation {
  unpublishProduct(where: { id: "..." }, from: PUBLISHED) {
    id
  }
}
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="With locales">

```graphql
mutation {
  unpublishProduct(
    where: { id: "..." }
    from: PUBLISHED
    unpublishBase: true
    locales: [en]
  ) {

  }
}
```

## Versioning

Versioning allows you to work non-destructively with content. Make changes, and recover previous versions with Hygraph.

Each time you publish to a content stage, history is written.

<Card theme="warning">

Versions of documents are kept for a minimum of 30 days, for paid plans. [Upgrade your plan](/pricing) for longer history retention.

</Card>

### Fetching version history

You can fetch all of the history by `stage`. `history` is a [system field](/api-reference/schema/system-fields#version-history-fields).

For example, let's get all of the `history` for `products`.

<Tabs panelHeight={270}>
  <TabItem label="Request">

```graphql
{
  products(stage: PUBLISHED) {
    history {
      id
      stage
      revision
      createdAt
    }
  }
}
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Response">

```json
{
  "data": {
    "products": [
      {
        "history": [
          {
            "id": "ckdt47uio02al01044grc4ehf",
            "stage": "PUBLISHED",
            "revision": 4,
            "createdAt": "2020-11-02T10:28:24.273413+00:00"
          },
          {
            "id": "ckdt47uio02al01044grc4ehf",
            "stage": "PUBLISHED",
            "revision": 3,
            "createdAt": "2020-11-02T10:01:40.453523+00:00"
          },
          {
            "id": "ckdt47uio02al01044grc4ehf",
            "stage": "PUBLISHED",
            "revision": 2,
            "createdAt": "2020-11-02T10:01:36.351916+00:00"
          },
          {
            "id": "ckdt47uio02al01044grc4ehf",
            "stage": "PUBLISHED",
            "revision": 1,
            "createdAt": "2020-11-02T10:00:22.14774+00:00"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Card theme="info">

Replace `stage: PUBLISHED` with `stage: QA` to get history from custom stage `QA`.

</Card>

### Fetching a single version

You can use a the generated `[model]Version` query to fetch a single version of a content entry.

Since models can be complex, and change over time. The `data` field is a JSON field that returns a snapshot of the content entry at that time.

Using the `id`, and `revision` from the previous query, we can fetch the `data` of the version, including the relations metadata.

<Tabs panelHeight={270}>
  <TabItem label="Request">

```graphql
{
  productVersion(
    where: { id: "ckdt47uio02al01044grc4ehf", revision: 4, stage: PUBLISHED }
  ) {
    id
    stage
    revision
    data
  }
}
```
