Hygraph webhooks are a fundamental method for observing changes that happen to content within your project.

Whether new content is published, or existing is updated, subscribe to these events, and get notified via a `POST`, `DELETE`, `PUT`, or `GET` request to perform your own custom business logic.

For example, you could use webhooks for:

- Syncing data to external search engine,
- Syncing data with external PIM,
- Redeploying your static website when content or assets change,
- Triggering email campaigns based on new content added.
- Push messages into Slack.

**Webhooks are environment specific**. This means their configuration is applied per environment. Take this into consideration if you're working with a project using more than one environment.

## Triggers

Triggers can be configured to listen to one or more content model, stage, and action events.
It is also possible to specify a trigger source, which allows triggering only when content is changed by the specified source: a [Permanent Auth Token (PAT)](/docs/api-reference/basics/authorization#permanent-auth-tokens), a project member editing content via the webapp or via public API.

| Trigger       |                                                                                                                    |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Content Model | All models, including `Asset`                                                                                      |
| Stage         | Draft, Published, and [custom content stages](/docs/api-reference/content-api/content-stages)                      |
| Action        | Create, Update, Delete, Publish, and Unpublish                                                                     |
| Source        | [Permanent Auth Token](/docs/api-reference/basics/authorization#permanent-auth-tokens), Project Member, Public API |

- Webhook requests time out after 3000 ms.
- The current retry policy is 4 retries on top of the initial request, that is, 5 requests in total.

## Receiving a webhook

<Card theme="info">

Once events occur, a new webhook will be queued. It could be several minutes before a webhook is triggered, so make sure to create your application with this in mind.

</Card>

Once an event occurs, data is sent as JSON in a `POST`, `DELETE`, `PUT`, or `GET` request body to the configured URL. The contents of the request always contain the `operation`, and `data` of the event.

The `data` object will always contain the `__typename`, `id` and `stage` keys.

If the webhook is configured to include entry payloads, the following keys will also be included inside the `data` object:

- All other non-localized fields on the entry.
- The `id` and `__typename` of any related entries.
- An optional `localizations` array, containing any localized fields on the entry.

The snapshot of the current stage is only sent in the webhook body. This means that:

- Create, Update, and Delete actions only send the draft version.
- Publishing, and Unpublishing actions only send the published version.

## Securing webhooks

It is best to protect the endpoints which your webhooks invoke. This prevents unauthorized actions on your server, and better protects your users from any suspicious activity.

You should set a shared `secret key` on your webhook, which can be used to validate the request came from Hygraph.

![Hygraph webhook secret key](/images/docs/api-reference/basics/webhook-secret-key.png)

Hygraph will send the header `gcms-signature` on webhooks with a shared secret key set.

A `gcms-signature` header value looks like this:

```
sign=x0jU8z7AXAARIDBgsiVyfOG000wb2HhqN/mxl6+RSMk=, env=test, t=1631270481036
```

## Validating webhook signatures

Using the `gcms-signature` header, you can validate the request came from Hygraph.

You'll need to generate a HMAC with the SHA256 hash function to generate a signature you can use to compare against the `gcms-signature` header.

### Hygraph utils

To make things easier for developers working with Node, we've released a small utility that will construct a new signature for you, with your values.

```bash
npm install @hygraph/utils
```

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Node">

```js
const { verifyWebhookSignature } = require('@hygraph/utils');

const secret = 'rCNwyiloY3oJYYkxgpBXaleIiUv5MYlx';

const body = {}; // Typically req.body
const signature = '...'; // Typically req.headers['gcms-signature']

const isValid = verifyWebhookSignature({ body, signature, secret });
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

You'll need the request body and headers to pass to `verifyWebhookSignature`.

If `isValid` is truthy then you can safely execute your webhook handler code knowing the request is genuine, otherwise you should abort any further action.

### Manual verification

You may also verify webhook signatures manually by generating your own signature using whatever cryptographic library can generate a SHA256 digest.

Let's break the `gcms-signature` header down:

```
sign=x0jU8z7AXAARIDBgsiVyfOG000wb2HhqN/mxl6+RSMk=, env=master, t=1631270481036
```

- `sign=` is the signature
- `env=` is the environment of the Hygraph project
- `t=` is the timestamp of the event

#### Step 1: Extract the signature and timestamp from the header

First you'll need to get the signature, and timestamp from the header so they can be used to construct a new payload. If you're using JavaScript, it could look something like this:

```jsx
const [rawSign, rawEnv, rawTimestamp] = signature.split(', ');

const sign = rawSign.replace('sign=', '');
const EnvironmentName = rawEnv.replace('env=', '');
const Timestamp = parseInt(rawTimestamp.replace('t=', ''));
```

#### Step 2: Prepare the payload string

You'll next need to create a string of the payload that will be hashed, using the request body. If you're using JavaScript, it could look something like:

```jsx
let payload = JSON.stringify({
  Body: JSON.stringify(body),
  EnvironmentName,
  TimeStamp: Timestamp,
});
```

#### Step 3: Generate the signature

Next, you'll want to generate the digest for comparison. If you're using JavaScript, it could look something like:

```jsx
const { createHmac } = require('crypto');

const hash = createHmac('sha256', secret).update(payload).digest('base64');
```

#### Step 4: Compare the signatures match!

All that's left to do is compare that the `sign=` value and `hash` match. If you're using JavaScript, this may look something like:

```jsx
const isValid = sign === hash;
```

## Localizations with webhooks

If the webhook is configured to include entry payloads, all localized fields on the entry will be included in the webhook body under the `localizations` key. See the section below for [some examples](#example-payload).

Webhook events are scoped to the entry and are **not** locale specific. For example, if publishing changes to an `en` entry localization, the webhook will still include any other localized versions of that entry in the payload.

## Example payload

Below are examples of an event on `DRAFT`, `PUBLISHED` and custom a Content Stage, which include the entry payload. There is also an example without the entry payload included.

In the examples below we have a `Post` model.

## Webhook Logs

Hygraph stores logs for all your webhooks, which can help you debugging webhook calls and checking the returned status codes and responses from your endpoints.

In order to view the logs of a webhook, head into the webhooks view and click the "View Logs" button on the available webhooks.

![Hygraph webhook logs button](/images/docs/api-reference/basics/webhook-logs-button.png)

You will see a list of webhooks being sent to your specified endpoint. The logs include a timestamp, HTTP status code, the content model, the performed action and the duration of the request.

![Hygraph webhook logs overview](/images/docs/api-reference/basics/webhook-log-overview.png)

Clicking on one of the items opens up a detail view, showing you both the request and response payload and the information from the overview. The request and response body is currently truncated at 500kb and 200kb respectively.
