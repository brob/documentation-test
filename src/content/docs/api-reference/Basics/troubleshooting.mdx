## Can't access part of the functionality

This might be a [permissions](/api-reference/basics/permissions) issue.

Take into consideration that while Management API permissions are global, content permissions are environment specific.

If you're getting a [401 error](/api-reference/basics/errors#401-unauthorized), the endpoint you requested requires a valid [Permanent Auth Token](/api-reference/basics/authorization#permanent-auth-tokens), or a environment may not exist for this project.

## Queries not returning complete results

This is a [pagination](/api-reference/content-api/pagination) issue.

The default size of results returned by queries fetching multiple entries is 10. You can provide a maximum of 100 to the first, or last arguments.

The limit of 10/100 applies to projects created after 14-06-2022. Projects created before that date have a limit of 100/1000.

Our pagination document also contains information about [pagination limits](/api-reference/content-api/pagination#pagination-limits), [nested pagination](/api-reference/content-api/pagination#nested-pagination), and [relay cursor connections](/api-reference/content-api/pagination#relay-cursor-connections).

## My query is too slow

This could be a [query complexity issue](/api-reference/basics/query-complexity). Our document on [splitting GraphQL queries](/api-reference/basics/query-complexity#splitting-gql-queries) in order to reduce their complexity, suggests three possible solutions:

- [Limiting query depth](/api-reference/basics/query-complexity#example-1-limiting-query-depth)
- [Fetching only necessary fields](/api-reference/basics/query-complexity#example-2-fetching-only-necessary-fields)
- [Using pagination](/api-reference/basics/query-complexity#example-3-using-pagination)

The document also contains information on [union query optimization](/api-reference/basics/query-complexity#union-queries), and on [how to use the complexity tree JSON output to calculate the cost of your queries](/api-reference/basics/query-complexity#complexity-tree-json-output).

## No invite found with this code

If when accepting an invitation to a project you get the error message `No invite found with this code`, please make sure you are logged in with the right account.

## Too many requests

This is related to our [rate limits](/api-reference/basics/rate-limits). When you exceed them, you get a [429 error](/api-reference/basics/errors#429-too-many-requests).

Our rate limits document contains information on how to tackle this using [Next.js](/api-reference/basics/rate-limits#nextjs), [Gatsby](/api-reference/basics/rate-limits#gatsby), and [Nuxt](/api-reference/basics/rate-limits#nuxt).

<Card theme="info">

The rate limiting depends on the current load of the shared region and the subscription plan. These limits can be lifted on dedicated clusters and enterprise plans. You can [contact sales](/contact) to request a custom plan.
