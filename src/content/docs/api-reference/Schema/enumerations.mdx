An enumeration (or enum for short) can be used to group values within a type. Enums can be useful to filter, and define certain content entries in your project.

For example, a product model may contain the enum `COMMODITY`, and values `Digital` and `Physical`.

Enums values can only contain alphanumeric characters, and underscores.

Learn more about [Enumerations](/docs/api-reference/schema/field-types#enumerations).

## Fetching enumeration values

You may want to fetch all possible values of an Enum you have created. You can do this via GraphQL using your projects API endpoint.

```graphql
{
  __type(name: "COMMODITY") {
    enumValues {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

## Creating an enumeration

1. Navigate to the schema editor in the side-bar.
2. If you don't see it, your role does not have access to the schema editor.
3. In the collapsible side-bar, next to the label "Enumerations", click the "+ Add" button.
4. Provide a display name, API ID and description.

## Adding enumeration values

Enums must begin with a capital letter.

1. Add a value in the input of the "Enumeration Values".
2. Press the return key or press the "Add to List" button.
3. Continue adding more items until the list is complete.

## Removing enumeration values

1. Navigate to the Enumeration area of the schema editor.
2. Open an enumeration you'd like to edit by pressing the "edit" button below the name of the enumeration you'd like to edit.
3. Locate the "-" icon next to the Enumeration pill.
4. Press the minus button to remove the Enumeration from the list.
5. Press "Update Enumeration".
